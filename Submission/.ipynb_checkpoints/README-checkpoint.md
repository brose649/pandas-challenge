# pandas-challenge
This is the Module 4 Challenge covering Pandas for the April-October 2024 Data Boot Camp

We were tasked with creating and manipulating Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

I utilized several different functions such as groupby and mean, but made particular use of binning with pd.cut.

I continue to be reminded by the importance of syntax in this assignments. Looking forward to the next module on Data Visualizations!
